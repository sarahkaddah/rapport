Incompatibilities between rapidly evolving centromeric components may be responsible for both the organization of centromeric regions and the reproductive isolation of emerging species.},

  abstract        = {In this report we review alpha-satellite DNA (AS) sequence data to support the following proposed scenario of AS evolution. Centromeric regions of lower primate chromosomes have solely "old" AS based on type A monomeric units. Type A AS is efficiently homogenized throughout the whole genome and is nearly identical in all chromosomes. In the ancestors of great apes, a divergent variant of the type A monomer acquired the ability to bind CENP-B protein and expanded in the old arrays, mixing irregularly with type A. As a result, a new class of monomers, called type B, was formed. The "new" AS families were established by amplification of divergent segments of irregular A-B arrays and spread to many chromosomes before the human-chimpanzee-gorilla split. The new arrays contain regularly alternating monomers of types A and B. New AS is homogenized within an array with little or no homogenization between chromosomes. Most human chromosomes contain only one new array and one or a few old arrays. However, as a rule only new arrays are efficiently homogenized. Apparently, in evolution, after the establishment of the new arrays homogenization in the old arrays stopped. Notably, kinetochore structures marking functional centromeres are also usually formed on the new arrays. We propose that homogenization of AS may be limited to arrays participating in centromeric function.},

Evolution of these tandemly repeated sequences has led to the existence of numerous families of monomers exhibiting specific organizational patterns. The limited amount of information available in non-human primates is a restriction to the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of alpha satellite DNA. We carried out the targeted high-throughput sequencing of alpha satellite monomers and dimers from the Cercopithecus solatus genome, an Old World monkey from the Cercopithecini tribe. Computational approaches were used to infer the existence of sequence families and to study how these families are organized with respect to each other. While previous studies had suggested that alpha satellites in Old World monkeys were poorly diversified, our analysis provides evidence for the existence of at least four distinct families of sequences within the studied species and of higher order organizational patterns. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using oligonucleotide probes that are able to target each family in a specific way showed that the different families had distinct distributions on chromosomes and were not homogeneously distributed between chromosomes. Our new approach provides an unprecedented and comprehensive view of the diversity and organization of alpha satellites in a species outside the hominoid group. We consider these data with respect to previously known alpha satellite families and to potential mechanisms for satellite DNA evolution. Applying this approach to other species will open new perspectives regarding the integration of satellite DNA into comparative genomic and cytogenetic studies.},

  abstract     = {Alpha satellite is the major repeated DNA element of primate centromeres. Specific evolutionary mechanisms have led to a great diversity of sequence families with peculiar genomic organization and distribution, which have till now been studied mostly in great apes. Using high throughput sequencing of alpha satellite monomers obtained by enzymatic digestion followed by computational and cytogenetic analysis, we compare here the diversity and genomic distribution of alpha satellite DNA in two related Old World monkey species, Cercopithecus pogonias and Cercopithecus solatus, which are known to have diverged about seven million years ago. Two main families of monomers, called C1 and C2, are found in both species. A detailed analysis of our datasets revealed the existence of numerous subfamilies within the centromeric C1 family. Although the most abundant subfamily is conserved between both species, our FISH experiments clearly show that some subfamilies are specific for each species and that their distribution is restricted to a subset of chromosomes, thereby pointing to the existence of recurrent amplification/homogenization events. The pericentromeric C2 family is very abundant on the short arm of all acrocentric chromosomes in both species, pointing to specific mechanisms that lead to this distribution. Results obtained using two different restriction enzymes are fully consistent with a predominant monomeric organization of alpha satellite DNA which coexists with higher order organization patterns in the Cercopithecus pogonias genome. Our study suggests a high dynamics of alpha satellite DNA in Cercopithecini, with recurrent apparition of new sequence variants and interchromosomal sequence transfer.},

  abstract        = {Phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of biogeographic descent among primate species are both complex and contentious. Here, we generate a robust molecular phylogeny for 70 primate genera and 367 primate species based on a concatenation of 69 nuclear gene segments and ten mitochondrial gene sequences, most of which were extracted from GenBank. Relaxed clock analyses of divergence times with 14 fossil-calibrated nodes suggest that living Primates last shared a common ancestor 71-63 Ma, and that divergences within both Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini are entirely post-Cretaceous. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs played an important role in the diversification of placental mammals. Previous queries into primate historical biogeography have suggested Africa, Asia, Europe, or North America as the ancestral area of crown primates, but were based on methods that were coopted from phylogeny reconstruction. By contrast, we analyzed our molecular phylogeny with two methods that were developed explicitly for ancestral area reconstruction, and find support for the hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of living Primates resided in Asia. Analyses of primate macroevolutionary dynamics provide support for a diversification rate increase in the late Miocene, possibly in response to elevated global mean temperatures, and are consistent with the fossil record. By contrast, diversification analyses failed to detect evidence for rate-shift changes near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary even though the fossil record provides clear evidence for a major turnover event ("Grande Coupure") at this time. Our results highlight the power and limitations of inferring diversification dynamics from molecular phylogenies, as well as the sensitivity of diversification analyses to different species concepts.},

Estimating ML phylogenies is computationally demanding, and careful examination of the results is warranted. This chapter focuses on PhyML, a software that implements recent ML phylogenetic methods and algorithms. We illustrate the strengths and pitfalls of this program through the analysis of a real data set. PhyML v3.0 is available from (http://atgc_montpellier.fr/phyml/).},

  abstract        = {Alpha-satellite is a family of tandemly repeated sequences found at all normal human centromeres. In addition to its significance for understanding centromere function, alpha-satellite is also a model for concerted evolution, as alpha-satellite repeats are more similar within a species than between species. There are two types of alpha-satellite in the human genome; while both are made up of approximately 171-bp monomers, they can be distinguished by whether monomers are arranged in extremely homogeneous higher-order, multimeric repeat units or exist as more divergent monomeric alpha-satellite that lacks any multimeric periodicity. In this study, as a model to examine the genomic and evolutionary relationships between these two types, we have focused on the chromosome 17 centromeric region that has reached both higher-order and monomeric alpha-satellite in the human genome assembly. Monomeric and higher-order alpha-satellites on chromosome 17 are phylogenetically distinct, consistent with a model in which higher-order evolved independently of monomeric alpha-satellite. Comparative analysis between human chromosome 17 and the orthologous chimpanzee chromosome indicates that monomeric alpha-satellite is evolving at approximately the same rate as the adjacent non-alpha-satellite DNA. However, higher-order alpha-satellite is less conserved, suggesting different evolutionary rates for the two types of alpha-satellite.},
